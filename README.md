# DayCounterMod

This is a mod I made for my friend.

It counts the days that have passed during playtime.

# How to use

There are a few keybinds that you can set up which affect the day counter:

- Enable / Disable GUI
- Pause / Unpause Day Counter
- Reset GUI (Beware that this action has no sort of confirmation!)

You can move the day counter GUI around using the command:

```/movedaycountergui x y```

x, y are integers and represent the topleft corner in which the GUI will go.

# To Do:
- Make it count time only on Hypixel
- Fix broken title
